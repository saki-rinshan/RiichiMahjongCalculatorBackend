# RiichiMahjongCalculatorBackend

Complete backend for the Riichi Mahjong Calculator tile recognition system. The "Mahjong OCR" works by first splitting the base image into tiles using
Darkflow's object detector (tiny-flow-voc3) and then classifies these images using google's mobilenet v1 model.



To setup and run this server, the file structure should be similar with
a darkflow folder installed at the root directory as well.


# Dependencies

darkflow and all of it's dependencies:
[Darkflow](https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow) -> Python3, tensorflow 1.0, numpy, opencv 3

express, fs-extra, mkdrip, socket.io

To run the server locally `node server/indexOld`. The server listens for socket.io events for "Img" which will process the image as data input.
